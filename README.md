## Installation

Follow these steps carefully to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository
Download the project files to your computer:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ju4700/noteroom.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project directory
Move into the newly created directory:
```bash
 cd noteroom
```

### 3. Install dependencies
Install all required packages listed in `package.json`:
```bash
 npm install
```

This will download and set up all the Node.js packages needed for the project.

### 4. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store sensitive data and configuration options. Add the following content:
```plaintext
 MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
 PORT=3000
```
- **MONGODB_URI**: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- **PORT**: The port number where the app will run (default is 3000).

Make sure you never share this file or commit it to version control.

### 5. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
Convert the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:
```bash
 npx tsc
```

This will generate a `dist/` folder containing the compiled JavaScript files.

### 6. Run database migrations (if any)
Ensure your MongoDB database is up and running. If there are any migrations or initial seed data, run them accordingly.

### 7. Start the development server
Launch the server in development mode:
```bash
 npm run dev
```
The server will start running, and you'll see the logs in your terminal.

### 8. Access the application
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:
```plaintext
 http://localhost:3000
```
You should now see the NoteRoom homepage!
